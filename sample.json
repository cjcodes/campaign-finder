Here&#039;s what you have to know. Find a littered area like a park, beach, or roadway (but look out for cars!). Pick a nice day. Anything but clothes (doy) Garbage bags (beyond the ones you&#039;re wearing!) Gardening gloves (or anything to protect your hands) Frame the event as a party to encourage turnout. Serve some post-cleanup snacks (in reusable containers!). Question:  What is an ABC party? Answer:  ABC stands for &quot;Anything But Clothes.&quot; You can wear anything you can find-- sheets, tablecloths, duct tape, garbage bags, furry animals-- to get people talking about your cleanup. Question:  Can I do my cleanup after the campaign has ended? Answer:  Yep, and you&#039;ll still be eligible for a scholarship! The above dates are just a recommendation based on when we think the campaign will be easiest to do. Header:  Separate Recyclables Copy:  Assign one person or team recyclables to make sure cans and bottles don&#039;t get mixed in with the trash. Header:  Look Out Copy:  Keep your eyes out for tiny pieces like candy wrappers and cigarettes, which are small but deadly to animals! Header:  Say Thanks Copy:  Make sure to thank everyone who helped out with the cleanup. If you know how much trash was collected, share the details! Invite your friends to wear anything but clothes for your cleanup. Eco-friendly + a little sexy &gt; eco-friendly + totally meh-xy. Right?? Take a photo of your group with all the trash bags full of trash you collected. Show off your (lack of) outfits! You saved animal lives and made the planet cleaner. Thanks! Clean Up Trash! Give everyone a trash bag or split people into teams. Marvel at how everyone lacks clothes but maintains decency. Remarkable! Haul it Away If you have curbside pickup, stack the bags there. If not, drop ‘em at a dump/recycling center. If possible, weigh the bags beforehand! Show us how much trash you collected and everyone&#039;s creative ABC outfits!

Make Something Share Something Bullying Mental Health self-esteem bullying mental health positivity body image motivation art crafts Friday, August 1, 2014 to Tuesday, September 30, 2014 Sunday, June 15, 2014 to Friday, August 1, 2014 https://docs.google.com/a/dosomething.org/document/d/18woW4gnNWHyqToQP0mjpEf_tKC... 1 Messages Posted Ready to get those good vibes flowin&#039; at your school? Let&#039;s do this. Sometimes people feel bad when looking in the mirror, so your note can cheer them up! Post ‘em after school hours. Recruit your friends to form a posting posse! Find both guys and girls so you can hit up all bathrooms. Sticky notes or paper and tape Markers, pens, and/or crayons Glitter if you want to get really fancy MORE GLITTER (optional) Question:  What should I write on the notes? Answer:  &quot;Joey, your hair looks great today!&quot; will only make Joeys feel good. Instead, generic messages like &quot;Confidence is beautiful,&quot; and inspirational quotes like this one by Eleanor Roosevelt: &quot;No one can make you feel inferior without your consent&quot; appeal to everyone. Question:  Why should I post notes in the bathroom? Answer:  The bathroom is a place where low self-esteem is likely to be triggered: lots mirrors, people fixing their hair, tucking in new shirts, and popping pimples. Give your peers something else to smile about other than how their shoes look with their new jeans. Question:  What if the notes get damaged or vandalized? Answer:  Keep a close watch on your notes. If they&#039;re constantly being vandalized, you may want to ask your administration to explain the program over the loudspeaker to give it some legitimacy. Otherwise, remove inappropriate notes &amp; replace them with new ones. Header:  Be Bold! Copy:  Make your notes pop. Use color, glitter, and bold lettering to draw people&#039;s attention. Header:  Be Inclusive! Copy:  Write generic messages that apply to everyone. Try, &quot;You look FIERCE today&quot; or &quot;You&#039;re beautiful inside and out.&quot; Header:  Respect the Space Copy:  Leave enough room so people can still use the mirrors. Otherwise you&#039;ll see more notes on the floor than next to your reflection. Header:  Clean Up Copy:  If notes fall, post &#039;em back! If they&#039;re vandalized, tear &#039;em and toss &#039;em. Header:  Switch it Up Copy:  Every week or so, replace the old notes so people have something new to smile about! Create and post encouraging notes in your school bathrooms to brighten your classmates&#039; day and motivate them to be positive to others. After you hang the notes on the mirrors, take a pic! The very best time to take a mirror selfie. Nice job! YOU deserve a Mirror Message for all the notes you hung. Create and Post! Great creative! Get crazy kind! The more notes you write, the better you feel. Aaaand repeat. Maintain the Mirror You&#039;re in charge of patrolling the bathrooms to make sure the notes stay in order.

Your postcard is a personal plea, not a form of embarrassment. Give it to the smoker when they can read it alone or just with you. Throw love, not shade. A postcard or piece of paper Markers, pens, whatevs. A computer (if you prefer to do this digitally) Glue or tape Question:  What if I don&#039;t know someone who smokes? Answer:  No friends or family members smoke? How &#039;bout classmates or friends of friends? If not, you can make more generic quitting messages and place the postcards in school lockers or around public places. Your cards with quitting resources can help any smoker who sees them. Question:  Do I have to make the postcard by hand? Answer:  Nope! You can do this digitally if you want. There&#039;s no wrong way to eat a Reese&#039;s- or make a non-smoking card. Question:  Where can I find more quitting resources? Answer:  Check out our Action Guide for a full list of quitting resources. Question:  What if the person doesn&#039;t want to quit? Answer:  Don&#039;t give up, but don&#039;t pressure that person. Quitting is hard and takes time. You&#039;ve already helped by providing quitting resources and showing your support. Let the person know you&#039;re there for them if they need anything, but otherwise, let them take their time. Question:  What are some ideas for reasons the smoker should quit? Answer:  Each reason for quitting is personal, but here are some ideas to get you started: I want you to be alive to walk me down the aisle. I want you to be able to make the track team this spring. I hate making out with you because your breath smells like cigarettes. Header:  Get Personal Copy:  The &quot;I want you to quit because...&quot; statement specifically shows why this person is important to you. See the Action Guide for some examples. Header:  Add Resources Copy:  Check out the Action Guide for quitting resources or find ones that are relevant to the smoker. Attach them to the back of the postcard. Header:  Be Prepared Copy:  The person may not want to quit even if you encourage them to. Be prepared for their reaction. If they&#039;re not ready, don&#039;t pressure them. Header:  Check In Copy:  If the person does want to quit, follow up with them to see how they&#039;re doing and if you can help. A personalized card is a great way to deliver quitting resources and that message of support. Take a picture of your completed postcard. You know you&#039;ve got mad art skillz- let&#039;s see &#039;em! Your postcard: hot! Thanks for helping a smoker. Create the Postcard! Include an &quot;I want you to quit because...&quot; statement that&#039;s personal to you and the smoker. Just make sure it&#039;s not guilty-trippy, k? Share the Postcard Give your card in person or, if you&#039;d prefer to keep it more anonymous, send it in the mail or online.

" This Father&#039;s Day season, get your dad&#039;s blood pressure checked. Face to Face Physical Health blood pressure heart health exercise nutrition heart health heart attack help parents Thursday, May 15, 2014 to Sunday, June 15, 2014 https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QZJ4PMkD6S2qjfQuQQWkMl_oDVV0KWG7pP-B9EhEcPU/... 1 People Helped Here are some tips for encouraging your dad to get his blood pressure checked: Taking your dad to get his blood pressure checked on Father&#039;s Day is a great way to spend time with him and show him how much you care. Although men are less likely to visit doctors than women, everyone should get checked. Grab an adult and get his or her blood pressure checked. Share these heart health facts with your dad if he needs some convincing Question:  Can I take someone else to get their blood pressure checked? Answer:  Absolutely! Everyone should check their blood pressure every one to two years. Bring your mom, your aunt, your uncle, your older cousin-- anyone you know who has a heart (which is probably everyone). Question:  What is a blood pressure machine? Answer:  In simply 5 minutes, a blood pressure machine can measure blood pressure (no lie). Almost all national drugstore chains have a free blood pressure monitor. Try this locator to find a drugstore with a blood pressure monitor near you. Question:  Ok, we got his blood pressure checked. What do these numbers mean? Answer:  There are two numbers that describe blood pressure. The number on top is called systolic pressure, and is the pressure in your blood vessels when your heart beats. The number on bottom is called diastolic pressure, and is the pressure in your blood vessels between heartbeats. Normal blood pressure is 120/80. Anything above 120/80 can be categorized as different types of high blood pressure. Read this guide to understand what those categories mean. Question:  What do we do after we&#039;ve taken his blood pressure? Answer:  Make sure to read this great guide from the American Hypertension Society. It will tell you everything you need to know about maintaining good blood pressure and steps to take if your dad gets a high blood pressure reading. Other tips for keeping healthy include eating a healthy diet (lots of fruits and veggies- go easy on the salt), being physically active for at least 2.5 hours per week, maintaining a healthy weight, and managing stress levels. Question:  My dad&#039;s blood pressure is higher than 120/80. What do we do? Answer:  A high reading isn’t the end of the world, but the first step in getting your dad’s health back on track. Have him schedule a doctor’s appointment to have it tested again. Use this locator to find a cheap (or free) health clinic near you, or use your own family doctor. The doctor will advise what lifestyle changes he should make to ensure his blood pressure is in good order. Header:  Find the Machine Copy:  Blood pressure machines are in most drugstores. If you can&#039;t find one, use this locator. Header:  Follow Directions Copy:  The machine is pretty straightforward, but if you&#039;re confused, follow the directions on the machine or ask a store employee for help. Header:  Read The Numbers Copy:  Remember to read and record his blood pressure. Use this guide to help you understand what the numbers mean. Header:  List Next Steps Copy:  Your plan will vary depending on his numbers. This guide will help you create a list of steps so both of you know what to do next. Header:  Visit A Doctor Copy:  Regardless of his numbers, encourage your dad to make an appointment with his doctor to get the best advice on staying healthy. Header:  Set A Date Copy:  Adults should get their blood pressure checked every year. Mark your calendars to get dad&#039;s blood pressure checked again next Father&#039;s Day. By checking your dad&#039;s blood pressure, you can help him get on the path towards a healthy heart. Ask someone at the drugstore take a pic of you and your dad while he&#039;s getting his pressure checked! Smile for healthy hearts! Nice pic! You&#039;re one step closer to a heart-healthy dad. Get Him Checked! Find a blood pressure machine in your area, follow the instructions, and record the numbers. Keep Him Healthy After he takes his blood pressure, assess the changes he should make to achieve a healthier heart. In honor of Father&#039;s Day, send us those blood pressure pics from May 15- June 15. heart health Physical Health Face to Face Healthy blood pressure can reduce the risk of heart attack, stroke, heart failure, and kidney disease.

" Demand high-speed Internet at your school with a badass photo. Share Something Take a Stand Education internet broadband speed protest FCC Saturday, March 15, 2014 to Sunday, June 15, 2014 https://docs.google.com/a/dosomething.org/document/d/1L7hTNlk8liuHtgHT547bnXzt3B... 0.5 Photos Uploaded A School Standstill photo is a protest showing you at school paused, trying to do something that requires speed. Roll deep: the more friends in your photo, the stronger your statement. Camera or phone Printout of this image to hold up in your photo Question:  What&#039;s a School Standstill photo? Answer:  A School Standstill photo is a badass protest statement. It shows you at school doing something that requires speed-- except you can’t because you’re “buffering” or “loading.” The photo is about that moment where downloading a YouTube video takes, like, the entire afternoon. Question:  What will you do with the photos uploaded? Answer:  We&#039;ll be compiling the images and sharing them with Channel 1, who is leading the charge on pressuring the FCC to increase the high-speed Internet budget. Question:  Why is high-speed Internet important in schools? Answer:  Slow Internet wastes valuable class time and makes it difficult for teachers and students to use digital resources for learning. About 97% of low-income students rely on school for internet access. Question:  How many schools in the U.S. do not have access to high speed internet? Answer:  About 72% of schools! In other countries like South Korea, close to 100% of schools have high-speed Internet. Question:  Wait so...what the heck is the FCC? Answer:  The Federal Communications Commission regulates interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite and cable in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and U.S. territories. An independent U.S. government agency overseen by Congress, the commission is the United States&#039; primary authority for communications law, regulation and technological innovation. Basically, they manage the money that gets things to happen on the Internet. Header:  Hold the Timer Copy:  In your picture, make sure the image of the hourglass is visible in front of you. You know, like an old-school &quot;loading&quot; situation. Header:  Get a Friend Copy:  Have a buddy snap the shot for you. Phone photos will do the trick, because who has a camera nowadays anyway? Header:  Hashtag Hardcore Copy:  Instagram to your photo with hashtags #WeNeedSpeed and #FCC. Location tag your school so people know where you&#039;re from. Header:  Give Instructions Copy:  Print out the instructions and hang them in your library or computer lab to show others how to participate. Take a School Standstill photo to pressure the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to approve high-speed Internet in all schools. Take a few snaps and pick the funniest one to upload here. Thanks! Hope you&#039;re not still waiting for your page to load. Strike a Pose! For your School Standstill photo, think of a time you need to move quickly, like running in gym or scribbling notes in class.

" Start a petition to demand all-gender bathrooms in your dorm. Improve a Space Take a Stand Discrimination Mental Health Physical Health Sex Violence gender neutral bathrooms all-gender bathrooms gender sexuality identity Saturday, March 1, 2014 to Thursday, May 1, 2014 https://docs.google.com/a/dosomething.org/document/d/1wFCeo-Ovzl08kl0Arx-T1Qk_4u... 2 Names Signed Here&#039;s what you&#039;ll need to create your experiential petition, which will feature information on gender and all-gender bathrooms: Set up your experiential petition in all of the bathrooms on your dorm&#039;s floor. If you can, talk to people who might feel safer using all-gender bathrooms about problems they&#039;ve experienced &amp; how can they be fixed. Paper Markers, crayons, pens, etc. Computer Tape It may be helpful to talk to your dorm mates and even your RA about this petition to get them on board before you start. Question:  Wait...aren&#039;t sex and gender the same thing? I&#039;m a guy and I&#039;m male? Answer:  Actually, no! &quot;Sex&quot; = organs, hormones, and chromosomes (what defines you as male-bodied or female-bodied and is what is put on your birth certificate). &quot;Gender Identity&quot; = how you define yourself, and &quot;gender expression&quot; is how you portray your gender identity. You can be biologically female but identify as male (go by &quot;he&quot; and &quot;him&quot; pronouns), and dress masculine or feminine (remember, &quot;men&#039;s clothing&quot; and &quot;women&#039;s clothing&quot; has no real meaning except to reference size of the clothing). The action guide in the Stuff You Need section has more definitions. Question:  Why do we need all-gender bathrooms? Answer:  Everyone deserves access to public bathrooms. No one should have to fear violence or harassment in a bathroom. To get an idea of what trans and gender-nonconforming people experience, look for a gender-neutral restroom in a public space or imagine entering the opposite sex&#039;s restroom. Question:  Why should transgender people receive special privileges? Answer:  Safely using a public restroom is a right, not a privilege. All-gender bathrooms aren’t only for transgender people. Many people who don’t identify as transgender don’t appear stereotypically male or female and may feel unsafe in gender-specific bathrooms. Also, fathers taking care of daughters (or mothers taking care of sons) or caretakers taking care of disabled people of the opposite sex benefit from all-gender bathrooms as well. Question:  There aren’t any transgender or gender nonconforming people in our dorm. Why should we make all-gender bathrooms for people who aren’t even here? Answer:  Just because you don’t think you know trans or gender nonconforming people doesn’t mean they’re not there-- or that they won’t be in the future. There are other people who may want all-gender bathrooms, regardless of their gender identity. Question:  What would all-gender bathrooms look like? Answer:  First, you&#039;d replace the gender-specific stick figures on the door that indicate &quot;men&#039;s&quot; or &quot;women&#039;s&quot; room. Instead, the door would just have a sign that says “all-gender bathroom.” Some all-gender bathrooms also have icons that indicate the type of facilities within the bathroom (for example, an all-gender bathroom with a urinal in it may indicate that in case people want to specifically use a urinal). Bathrooms could be either multi-stall or single-stall. Many people prefer using single-stall restrooms with locks on the doors. Question:  If we had all-gender bathrooms, wouldn&#039;t women be less safe? Answer:  This is definitely a thought that many people have about all-gender bathrooms. But if you think about it, gender-specific bathrooms don&#039;t have anything protecting women in the bathroom (there&#039;s no invisible sensor that throws predators out if they enter). Gender-specific bathrooms don&#039;t prevent sexual assault, and if anything, they provide an illusion of safety that is not true. Question:  Won&#039;t all-gender bathrooms make people feel uncomfortable? Answer:  Using an all-gender bathroom can feel kind of weird at first, because most people have never used them. But this feeling of discomfort compared with the inability for trans and gender non-conforming people to use the bathroom in public spaces should be prioritized over the discomfort of acclimating to something new. Header:  Define Terms Copy:  Tape definitions of terms &amp; quotes about gender identity, expression, &amp; biological sex (found in the Action Guide) on the mirrors. Header:  Answer Questions Copy:  Tape questions about all-gender bathrooms (found in the Action Guide) on the inside of the stalls. Header:  Encourage Signatures Copy:  Create the petition and post it over the gender symbol on the door for your dorm mates to sign when they leave the bathroom. Header:  Give Options Copy:  If your admin won’t make every bathroom all-gender, ask to make a unisex bathroom into an all-gender one by switching up the signage. Turning your college dorm bathroom into an interactive learning experience will encourage your dorm mates to sign your petition because they&#039;ll understand the need for all-gender dorm bathroom options. Be the first to sign your petition! Snap a pic of you signing the paper on the bathroom door. Thanks for standing up for what&#039;s right! Create the Petition! The petition will be featured in key places in the bathroom. Residents will learn about the issue when they enter until they leave. Deliver the Petition Give it to your Director of Housing or head of your dorm. Use the Action Guide to help explain the importance of all-gender bathrooms.
